It is always served with an extra generous crack of black pepper on top, and true Romans never ask for additional cheese because the ratio is already perfect."

        "text": "Finely dice your onion, carrot, and celery into tiny uniform pieces, almost a paste consistency. Heat olive oil in a large heavy bottomed pot over medium heat and add all the vegetables along with the minced garlic. Cook gently, stirring occasionally, for about 8 minutes until everything softens, sweetens, and turns slightly golden. This aromatic base is the foundation of your entire sauce, so take your time here."

        "text": "Pour in your red wine and let it bubble away for about 2 minutes until most of the liquid has evaporated and you are left with concentrated flavor. Add the dried lentils, crushed tomatoes, dried oregano, thyme, and a bay leaf. Give everything a good stir and season generously with salt and pepper. The lentils will absorb a lot of seasoning as they cook, so do not be shy here."

        "title": "Simmer Low and Slow",
        "text": "Add about 3 cups of water or vegetable stock to the pot, just enough to cover the lentils by about an inch. Bring to a gentle simmer, then reduce the heat to low, cover with a lid slightly ajar, and let it cook for 35 to 45 minutes. Stir every 10 minutes or so and add more liquid if things get too thick. The sauce is ready when the lentils are tender and the whole thing has reduced to a rich, thick consistency."

        "text": "Taste your sauce and adjust the seasoning one final time. Remove the bay leaf. Serve ladled generously over al dente pasta, creamy polenta, or spiralized zucchini noodles if you prefer something lighter. Finish each plate with torn fresh basil leaves and a drizzle of your best olive oil. This sauce tastes even better the next day, so make extra and thank yourself later."

      "origin": "Bolognese hails from Bologna in Italy's Emilia Romagna region, prepared since the late 18th century. Traditional versions use ground beef and pork with soffritto, wine, and tomatoes. This lentil version honors the slow cooked spirit while remaining entirely plant based.",
      "facts": [
        "The soffritto, finely chopped onion, carrot, and celery, should be cooked gently until the vegetables practically melt into the oil. This is the flavor foundation.",
        "Use brown or green lentils, not red. They hold their shape during 35 to 45 minutes of simmering rather than dissolving to mush.",
        "Red wine should be cooked down until most liquid evaporates, removing the raw alcohol taste while concentrating fruity, tannic flavor.",
        "The sauce tastes even better the next day, making it perfect for meal prep. Freeze extras in individual portions."
      ],
      "tradition": "Serve over sturdy pasta like rigatoni or pappardelle that can stand up to the hearty sauce. Add fresh basil at the very end to preserve its bright flavor and provide unmistakable Italian character."
