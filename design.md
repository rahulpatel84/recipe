## SaaS Product Look & Feel Prompt Design this page with a **calm, professional, product-first SaaS aesthetic**. The interface should feel **soft but structured**, **confident but understated**, and clearly part of a **mature, data-driven software product** used daily by professionals. ### Visual Character * Clean, modern, and restrained * Soft surfaces with subtle depth * Professional and trustworthy, never flashy * Feels stable, reliable, and intentional * More “internal tool” than “marketing site” --- ### Color & Softness * Neutral base colors with low saturation * Light backgrounds or soft tinted surfaces * Primary color used sparingly and purposefully * No gradients, no loud accents * Soft contrast rather than sharp or dramatic contrast --- ### Typography Feel * Modern sans-serif with excellent readability * Medium to regular weights preferred * Clear but quiet hierarchy * No oversized or expressive headlines * Text feels informational, not promotional --- ### Components & Surfaces * Cards, inputs, and panels feel slightly elevated * Subtle borders or very soft shadows * Rounded corners used consistently and modestly * Components feel tactile but minimal * Nothing feels heavy, bold, or aggressive --- ### UI Tone * Calm and composed * Functional and system-driven * Confident without trying to sell * Designed for repeat usage, not first-time excitement --- ### Overall Impression When viewing the page, it should feel like: * A trusted SaaS product * A system already in use * Part of a cohesive platform * Quietly polished, not attention-seeking --- ### Avoid * Marketing or landing-page styling * Flashy visuals or expressive graphics * Harsh contrast or heavy shadows * Emotional or hype-driven tone * Anything that feels decorative over functional ---
